The central program is a space for community engagement and services in addition to unprogrammed spaces that provide opportunities for lingering interaction and conversation. The design intends to create a relatively seamless experience between the street and the other urban contexts, allowing for more connectivity with the urban fabric and engagement with pedestrian traffic.",

        "This project aims to create a composition of indoor and outdoor spaces that intertwine the community center with the surrounding park. The site was only limited to The Grove at Dorothea Dix Park in Raleigh, North Carolina with flexibility on the placement as long as it followed the project’s guiding principle of designing a space in communication with the park. Due to time constraints with this project, we adapted our previous project’s program to reflect the new site. My design aims to be minimally invasive to the landscape through the act of peeling the topography to reveal the additional park program of a basktball court and stadium seating. The only conditioned spaces are service for the community center’s staff, blurring the line between indoor and outdoor space.",

The competition is for ARC 232 students only; the winning teams are awarded cash prizes.>This project was designed in collaboration with Fabiola Minerali, Justin Par, and Litzy Rodriguez. Our masonry unit was designed primarily for screen-wall applications but can also be structural when deployed in a stacked bonding pattern. We wanted to create visual interest using an angled pattern while considering extrusion methods. This is ultimately how we arrived at this design.>For our model, we opted to cast the design as a 1:1 example using concrete with perlite and vermiculite as aggregates. Our concrete masonry unit design was awarded second place in the design competition.",
