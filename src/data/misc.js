        "After roughly five years of working in the specialty coffee industry, a restaurant group approached me to assist in designing and developing a coffee bar. My primary role was to provide the general contractor and architect with plans for the bar and a complete equipment list. While the managing partner was traveling abroad, I worked on-site during the buildout to ensure everything went as smoothly as possible. In addition to the plan for the bar, I designed a shelving system that would allow the cafe to openly display the coffee and wares while also providing functional storage for service.>The owner was working on a tight budget and did not want to spend tens of thousands of dollars on an espresso machine, so I worked alongside Kyle Ramage and Black & White Coffee Roasters to refurbish a twenty-year-old La Marzocco espresso machine. Lastly, the final project I worked on for this cafe was in collaboration with Joe Sink, a local potter, who worked with me to design wares for espresso-based drinks. The owner was interested in a more rusticated cafe experience, so I proposed hand-turned espresso wares to deliver a warmer and more tactile experience.",
