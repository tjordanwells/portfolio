I incorporated their branding into the Shopify account and provided documentation for their employees to maintain the site after it launched. We tested the launch with a limited-edition t-shirt as proof of concept. I also worked with Brian and Enoch to catalog their inventory into a more modern database and wrote a script that populated their Shopify site with all the stock they tracked using a spreadsheet.",

The brand alignment included a new colorway that responded to the new album while also calling back to their catalog. In addition to the updated theme, I implemented a new font and, most importantly, an integration with the artist service, SEATED. This integration provides fans with an updated calendar of upcoming tour dates.",

The main problem that this web application addressed was a way for the employees to update the current location of the airstream, which was extremely necessary to drive business. The Google Maps integration was developed with a custom pin that allows people to locate the Airstream coffee trailer. The employees were provided a single-field form to submit the current location, which would update the website in real-time upon submission.",

One of the most exciting qualities regarding digital, generative art is the ability to use sound, keyboards, web cameras, and other input devices to manipulate the canvas. To explore this, I created an interactive canvas allowing a user to experiment with the colors that Albers used to paint his iconic series.",
